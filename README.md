The skeleton code from my music library website. This is what I run on my home network to share my music library on every html5 compatable device. It isn't that pretty, though I am planning to change that eventually. 

Requires: Music, Album Covers, JQuery, Filled out JSON file for library. 

TODO: Divide up the library some way. My personal one is roughly 100MB of stuff I have hand typed. Make the CSS prettier. Different layouts for organizing the music, because it gets harder to find what you want with a reasonably large library. Optimize the search function.
